témoignage: I wanted to work on my posture and flexibility. We set up weekly virtual sessions with Helena, with personal exercises assigned in between. I was able to improve significantly over a year. Helena is very well prepared and sessions have a good rhythm. Her bubbly personality brings spice to the workout. I highly recommend it!
